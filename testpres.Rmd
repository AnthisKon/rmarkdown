##  Intro - Dataset
I just used the famous **titanic** dataset and went for the minimum criteria to pass the assigment. Just too many courses :)


## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

 plot_ly(titanic_train, x = ~ Age, y = ~Fare, color = ~as.factor(Survived), type = 'scatter') 

```
